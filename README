# Introduction

(W)ick (I)nteractive (Sh)ell || (W)ish (I)nteractive (Sh)ell

wish is an interactive shell program similar to `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`.
However, wish is a simple C core which can be extended via GNU Guile scripts.

# Usage

1. Create a `~/wishrc.scm` file in your home directory
   1. You can see a simple example `wishrc.scm` in the `src` directory of the
	 wish code repository.
2. Invoke `wish` as you would any other shell

# TODO

1. add a way to accept and execute arbitary Guile scheme from the `wish` prompt
2. add a way to accept and defer evaluation of arbitrary functions defined in
`wishrc.scm`
3. add support for piping program output to another program
4. add support for output redirection (the general case of #3)
